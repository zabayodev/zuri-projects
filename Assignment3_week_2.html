				About Charles Babbage
			</h1>
             <p>
                Charles Babbage was born on December 26, 1791 at 
                44 Crosby Row, Walworth Road, London, England.<br><br>
				He was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage 
                and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a banking 
                partner of William Praed in founding Praed's & Co. 
                of Fleet Street, London, in 1801.<br><br>
				In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old 
                Rowdens house in East Teignmouth. Around the age 
                of eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in
                Alphington near Exeter.<br><br>
                He arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 
                October 1810. He was already self-taught in 
                some parts of contemporary mathematics;[19] he 
                had read Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange,
                and Marie Agnesi. As a result, he was disappointed 
                in the standard mathematical instruction available 
                at the university.<br><br>
				Babbage, John Herschel, George Peacock, and several
                other friends formed the <strong>Analytical Society</strong>
                in 1812, they were also close to Edward Ryan Rejoining 
                DRDO in 1982.<br><br> 
                He was also a member of other societies such as The 
                <strong>Ghost Club</strong>, concerned with 
                investigating supernatural phenomena,and the <strong>
                Extractors Club</strong> dedicated to liberating its 
                members from the madhouse, should any be committed to
                 one.<br><br>
                In 1812, Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, Cambridge.
                He was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate 
                with honours. He instead received a degree without examination
                in 1814.<br><br>
                He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815, 
                and was elected a of the <strong>Royal Society </strong> 
                in 1816.<br><br>
                Babbage was instrumental in founding the <strong>Royal 
                Astronomical Society</strong>  in 1820, initially known 
                as the Astronomical Society of London.[35] Its original
                aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more
                standard form, and to circulate data.<br><br>
                In 1816 Babbage, Herschel and Peacock published a translation 
                from French of the lectures of <strong>Sylvestre Lacroix</strong>,
                which was then the state-of-the-art calculus textbook.<br><br>

               <blockquote>
                Reference to <strong> Lagrange</strong> calculus terms marks out the 
                application of what are now called <strong>formal power series</strong>.
                British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760. As re-introduced, 
                they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus. They opened
                 up the fields of functional equations (including the difference 
                 equations fundamental to the difference engine) and operator (D-module) 
                 methods for differential equations
               </blockquote>.<br>
